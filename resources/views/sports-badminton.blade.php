        <h3 class="mt-4 text-3xl font-bold text-center tracking-tight text-indigo-600 uppercase">RULES AND REGULATIONS</h3>
        <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-center leading-8 text-gray-500 max-w-[50vw]">
            Most Badminton tournaments begin with a coin toss. Flipping a coin
            determines which player will serve first and which side of the court to
            serve from.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-center tracking-tight text-gray-600 capitalize">Serve Rotation</h3>
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg text-center leading-8 text-gray-500 max-w-[50vw]">
            At the start of the game, and whenever the serving side wins a point, the serving side's players switch sides.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-center tracking-tight text-gray-600 capitalize">Serve Placement</h3>
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg text-center leading-8 text-gray-500 max-w-[50vw]">
            The server must serve from within the service court diagonally to the opponent's service court.
            The shuttle must pass over the net and land within the boundary lines of the opponent's service court.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-center tracking-tight text-gray-600 capitalize">Order of Service</h3>
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg text-center leading-8 text-gray-500 max-w-[50vw]">
            In doubles, the service order must be maintained throughout the game. The player in the right service court serves when their side has an even score,
            and the player in the left service court serves when their side has an odd score.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-center tracking-tight text-gray-600 capitalize">Scoring a Point</h3>
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg text-center leading-8 text-gray-500 max-w-[50vw]">
            A point is scored when the shuttlecock lands in the opponent's court, either on the floor or within the boundary lines.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-center tracking-tight text-gray-600 capitalize">Faults</h3>
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg text-center leading-8 text-gray-500 max-w-[50vw]">
            Various faults can occur, such as the shuttlecock landing out of bounds,
            a player touching the net with any part of their body or racket, or a player obstructing their opponent's shot.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-center tracking-tight text-gray-600 capitalize">Let</h3>
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg text-center leading-8 text-gray-500 max-w-[50vw]">
            In certain situations, the rally may be stopped and a let called, and the point replayed.
            This can happen if the shuttlecock hits the net and lands in bounds, among other scenarios.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-center tracking-tight text-gray-600 capitalize">Changing Ends</h3>
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg text-center leading-8 text-gray-500 max-w-[50vw]">
            Players change ends after each game and when the leading score reaches 11 points in the third game.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-center tracking-tight text-gray-600 capitalize">Interval</h3>
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg text-center leading-8 text-gray-500 max-w-[50vw]">
            There is a 1-minute interval between the first and second games, and a 2-minute interval between the second and third games.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-center tracking-tight text-gray-600 capitalize">Scoring</h3>
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg text-center leading-8 text-gray-500 max-w-[50vw]">
            A badminton match is usually played best out of three games. Each game is played to 21 points, and a point is scored on every serve.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-center tracking-tight text-gray-600 capitalize">Winning the Game</h3>
        <p class="mt-3 text-lg text-center leading-8 text-gray-500 max-w-[50vw]">
            The side that scores 21 points first wins a game. If the score reaches 20-20, the side that scores two consecutive points wins.
            If the score reaches 29-29, the side that scores the 30th point wins.
        </p>
